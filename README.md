## Dialog Type

If you want to use limited dialog, you have to use the following code:

```
invoke-static/range {p0 .. p0}, Lmeh/vittens/moddialog/ModDialog;->prepare(Landroid/app/Activity;)V
```

If you want to use unlimited dialog, you have to use the following code:

```
invoke-static/range {p0 .. p0}, Lmeh/vittens/moddialog/ModDialog;->showCrackerDialog(Landroid/content/Context;)V
```

`Limited Dialog` has the following system:
- A dialog will appear on the first launch of the application.
- This dialog will appear only once, if you have opened the first application then the second time it will not appear again.

`Unlimited Dialog` has the following system:
- A dialog will appear on the first launch of the application.
- This dialog will appear repeatedly, if you have opened the first application then the second time it will appear again.
